euclids elements
Mathematics for programmers

complexity
functino types - how they grow

what is 0/0?
1/1 1/0 0/1 - consider

division \expressed a multi
0/0 = ? => 0 * ? = 0 ===== ? can be anyyting ; undefined

domain input
range output

func types we care about
linear
constant
quad
sqaure root
expo
log
factorial

greather than n^2
take out n^2 part -> optimize and run it n times

sqrt runtime ->>>>>>>>>>>>>>> whaaaaaaaaa
figuring out with a number is a prime - only have to chekc up to square root of number
ex2. precomputing

exponential runtime
ex1. combinations and permutations

factorial runtmie
fibonacci no memoization

limits
as x become closer to some value c, what does function do
1/x  = x ^ 0 / x ^ 1
same rates -> look at coefficients
* look at rates to figure limits

review asymptotes?  horizzatonal vs verticla
horizaontl: take x -> inf
vertical: set dominornator to 0 and solve

nlog(n) -> pseudolinear , best runtimes for sorting algos


MODULAR ARITHMATIC
2 major uses
  iterate over a set and go back to the start
  security

take numberline an mkae it a circle
7%3 = 1
^ hard to figure out based only on input form x %3 = 1

combinations and permutations
n : number of elememtns
r : number of things in choice
nPr = n! / (n-r)! -> permutation order matters
combinations combining choices; order doesnt matter -> nCr = n! / ((r!)(n-r)!)
