Mock Interview

________________________________________________

WHITEBOARDING
lsiten
example input / output - simple cases. solve base case first
brute force
optimize
walk through
implement
test

\  50 - 80 resumes ~ 100  per job/
      10 for recruiter phone calls - research company, role,
        8-9 tech or phone screen
          4 -5 for onsite
            1-2 for offers
              \ /
               1

statisically , if avg, need to apply to 80 josb for an offer

on resume, interviewer looks for overlap of my experience and their needs

1 or 2 technical questions that grow harder over optimize
unless asked to give a runtime constraint, solve in brute force first
  if i fail optimizing, i can have an answer in brute force
optimize next
  left to right, right to left; precomputing -> optimizatino techniques
walkthrough
test
  dont erase history with variables, keep trac of old values
think of interview as a PRESENTATION

PROBLEM structure
  starts simple
  builds in dificulty over runtime
  aims to identify the candidates skill level

I CANNOT JUSTIFY RECOMMENDING HIRING A CANDIDATE WHO DOES NOT REACH A WORKABLE SOLUTION WITHIN THE TIME LIMIT

BUD Approach
  bottlenecks - part of the code that is sufficiently worse that everythign has to go through
  unnecessary WORK - binary search ; dont need to look at all numbers; check middle and look at a half
  duplicate WORK - fibonacci -: memoization save work in hash


SOFT SKILLSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
  harder to teach - changing meeeeeee
questions to assess
  cultural fit
  emotional / personaly traits
  maturity level
  life goals/ passion
  expexted tenure
and
  can i work with you
  can we all work with you

tricsk to increase trust to get truth


STORY telling
  traditional hero narrative
    hero naive to a threat
    unexpectedly face teh threat and come off second best
    dnot understand why but seek understanding
    expereince a new  perspective thruogh a struggle or journey
    came back to the face the threat again but this time succeed

body language
indications of nerves and stress - not truethful or worried abotu whats gona say
disappearing
seld comforting
fidgeting
sweating
disappearing veins
low power "fig leaf"

idcations of defensiveenss
crossed arms legs
low bottleneckslow eyebrows

how to avaoid giving away indicators
maintain eye contact
smile
exposr veins
neutral power pose
touching
try to mentally lower the stress

how to prepare
breating
eating
activity

THinGS FOR ESLF TO DOOOOOO
limit personal family life conversation
focus on professional biography - takl about resume
  qualifications
  work experience
  years at company
  duties & responsibilities
tell a STORY
achievement oriented
talk about the role youre interviewing for and how you fit the PROBLEM

where do you see yoruself in 5 years
are you here fo rlong term
are you trying to get this josb
or trying to get a higher level in the fiture
discuss your focus to matery of the role
keep any discussino of promption to general terms
  i aim to be a key memeber
HOW TO answer
I DONT WANNA COMMIT TO THE SAME ROLE FOR 5 years
DONT WANnA COMMIT TO BEING THE BOSS
- I AM WITHIN 5 YEARS TO BE A MASTER OF X
I PLAN ON BEING A MASTER AND I IMAGENE BY 5 YEARS IL BE A KEY MEMER OF THIS TEAM

what are your weaknesses
not personaluty trait
not a strength in a disguide
must be something you can improve on

THIS LINES UP TO THE SORY narrative



WHYD you LEAVE YOUR LAST job / why you want to leave
  try not to bad mouth your last employer
  stay general, but dont get into specifics
  donti lie, references may not corroborate
  try to be conscious of body language
  ****explain why in this role you will not likely have the problems of your LAST
  performacne related firing
