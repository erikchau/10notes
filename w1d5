TODO over the weekend - come upw ith stories work on soft skills

Data structures
arrays - vectors - linked lists - queues and stacks

common properties of all data structures
dealing with set of items
  we can do things with set
  what are common things we wan to do

types
linked list - basis
array - what are they


LINKED LIST
stringssssssss
each char is 8 bits 1 byte
all memory is addressable by byte

chars and pointers in C

VECTORS:
  dynamically sized
  insert - AMORTIZD O(1)

ARC - automatic refernce counting - CLANG

LINKED LIST
broken chunks of data
non - contiguous
two part - thing held; address of where to find next thing
empty data in pointer  - end of list ; we are done
size used -
  s = size of 1 element(32 bit int)
  a = address 64 bits
  total :32 * 64 * n
- each elemtn stored within node
  each node has a reference to the next node
first thing is root or head
o -> o -> o -> 0

LRU CACHE uses ciruclar linked lists

MULTIPLY LINKED LIST
each node has not just one next pointer, but many
can store two types of order
ie age and name

SENTINEL NODES
subclass of node that indicates start and end
remove pointers in methods on linked lists

Qs and stacks
Q - enqueue
